            Concept: The concept is to replicate a traditional traffic lights with the red, yellow, and green lights. The changeLights function performs all the hard work. This rotates the traffic light through yellow and red, then back to green. As this gets called inside the loop function, the Arduino will run this code forever, with a 15-second pause every time.
            The changeLights function consists of four distinct steps:
            Green on, yellow off
            Yellow off, red on
            Yellow on, red on
            Green on, red off, yellow off
            These four steps replicate the process used in real traffic lights. For each step, the code is very similar. The appropriate LED gets turned on or off using digitalWrite. This is an Arduino function used to set output pins to HIGH (for on), or LOW (for off).
            After enabling or disabling the required LEDs, the delay makes the Arduino wait for a given amount of time. Three seconds in this case.

            The code below was gotten from arduino community, slack, Kay Waller, Lia Johansen, Lily Rosencrantz. They helped me fix my 
            Code and errors and allowed for my circuit to work.
            <br>
            <br>
              int red = 10; //red led is pin 10
              int yellow = 9; // yellow led is pin 9
              int green = 8; // green led is pin 8
              int button = 12; // switch is on pin 12
              void setup(){
              pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
              pinMode(yellow, OUTPUT);
              pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
              pinMode(button, INPUT);
              digitalWrite(green, HIGH);
            }
              void loop() {
              if (digitalRead(button) == HIGH){
              delay(15); // software debounce
              if (digitalRead(button) == HIGH) {
            // if the switch is HIGH, ie. pushed down - change the lights!
            changeLights();
            delay(3000); // wait for 3 seconds
        }
    }
}
            void changeLights(){
            // green off, yellow on for 2 seconds
            digitalWrite(green, LOW);
            digitalWrite(yellow, HIGH);
            delay(2000);
            // turn off yellow, then turn red on for 2 seconds
            digitalWrite(yellow, LOW);
            digitalWrite(red, HIGH);
            delay(2000);
            // red and yellow on for 2 seconds (red is already on though)
            digitalWrite(yellow, HIGH);
            delay(2000);
            // turn off red and yellow, then turn o n green
            digitalWrite(yellow, LOW);
            digitalWrite(red, LOW);
            digitalWrite(green, HIGH);
