            Below is an image of the schematic
            <br>
            <br>
            </br>
            <p>3.6V drop per white LED. 3 LEDs per segment of LED strip.</p>
            <p>3.6V * 3 = 10.8V drop over the three LEDs.</p>
            <p>12V (from power) = 10.8V (drop from LED) + V drop of resistor --> Resistor = 1.2V drop</p>
            <p>Resistor on LED segment says '241' --> 240 Ohm resistor.</p>
            <p>1.2/240 = 0.005A of current per LED segment</p>
            <p>used 102 LEDs, or 34 segments --> 0.005A * 34 = 0.17A of current for my LED strip.</p>
          </br>
            <p>For the photoresistor,  10k ohm resistor used to make sure the current was fully grounded when the switch is off.</p>
